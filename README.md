# Fileman
In many software systems the need exists to access files that are of general importance such as property files needed by different sub systems (technical requirements) or such as template files for output generated for customers (business requirements). Storing these files in a database is in many cases not the best solution. An application that makes hosted files accessible for machine-to-machine communication via a simple REST-interface is frequently to be preferred. *Fileman* represents a solution exactly for these requirements.

*Fileman* consists of two subsystems: a Java-Spring-Boot backend and an Angular9 frontend. The frontend allows conveniently to view, to search, to add, to remove and to change hosted files.
